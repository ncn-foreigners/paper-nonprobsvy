Both approaches depend on the accuracy of the data that Facebook provides about its users, but little is known about how accurate these data are. We address this gap in a large-scale, cross-national online survey (N = 137,224), in which we compare self-reported and Facebook-classified demographic information (sex, age and region of residence). Our results suggest that Facebook's advertising platform can be fruitfully used for conducing social science research if additional steps are taken to assess the accuracy of the characteristics under consideration.},

            Analysis of non-probability survey samples requires auxiliary information at the population level. Such information may also be obtained from an existing probability survey sample from the same finite population. Mass imputation has been used in practice for combining non-probability and probability survey samples and making inferences on the parameters of interest using the information collected only in the non-probability sample for the study variables. Under the assumption that the conditional mean function from the non-probability sample can be transported to the probability sample, we establish the consistency of the mass imputation estimator and derive its asymptotic variance formula. Variance estimators are developed using either linearization or bootstrap. Finite sample performances of the mass imputation estimator are investigated through simulation studies. We also address important practical issues of the method through the analysis of a real-world non-probability survey sample collected by the Pew Research Centre.},

            Data integration combining a probability sample with another nonprobability sample is an emerging area of research in survey sampling. We consider the case when the study variable of interest is measured only in the nonprobability sample, but comparable auxiliary information is available for both data sources. We consider mass imputation for the probability sample using the nonprobability data as the training set for imputation. The parametric mass imputation is sensitive to parametric model assumptions. To develop improved and robust methods, we consider nonparametric mass imputation for data integration. In particular, we consider kernel smoothing for a low-dimensional covariate and generalized additive models for a relatively high-dimensional covariate for imputation. Asymptotic theories and variance estimation are developed. Simulation studies and real applications show the benefits of our proposed methods over parametric counterparts.},

In this article, we study the asymptotic properties of the predictive mean matching estimator for finite-population inference using a superpopulation model framework. We also clarify conditions for its robustness. For variance estimation, the conventional bootstrap inference is invalid for matching estimators with a fixed number of matches due to the nonsmoothness nature of the matching estimator. We propose a new replication variance estimator, which is asymptotically valid. The key strategy is to construct replicates directly based on the linear terms of the martingale representation for the matching estimator, instead of individual records of variables. Simulation studies confirm that the proposed method provides valid inference.},

This estimating strategy mitigates the possible ﬁrst-step selection error and renders the doubly robust estimator root n consistent if either the sampling probability or the outcome model is correctly speciﬁed.},

	abstract = {The probability-sampling-based framework has dominated survey research because it provides precise mathematical tools to assess sampling variability. However increasing costs and declining response rates are expanding the use of non-probability samples, particularly in general population settings, where samples of individuals pulled from web surveys are becoming increasingly cheap and easy to access. But non-probability samples are at risk for selection bias due to differential access, degrees of interest, and other factors. Calibration to known statistical totals in the population provide a means of potentially diminishing the effect of selection bias in non-probability samples. Here we show that model calibration using adaptive LASSO can yield a consistent estimator of a population total as long as a subset of the true predictors is included in the prediction model, thus allowing large numbers of possible covariates to be included without risk of overfitting. We show that the model calibration using adaptive LASSO provides improved estimation with respect to mean square error relative to standard competitors such as generalized regression (GREG) estimators when a large number of covariates are required to determine the true model, with effectively no loss in efficiency over GREG when smaller models will suffice. We also derive closed form variance estimators of population totals, and compare their behavior with bootstrap estimators. We conclude with a real world example using data from the National Health Interview Survey.},
